### Overview

*Give a brief overview of your plugin. Include a link to its source code if you wish.*

Sunburst chart is used to visualize hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles. The circle in the centre represents the root node, with the hierarchy moving outward from the center. A segment of the inner circle bears a hierarchical relationship to those segments of the outer circle which lie within the angular sweep of the parent segment. This is an open source visual.
